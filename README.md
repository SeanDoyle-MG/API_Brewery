### Description of Project

The API provides the user contact information associated with all Brewery types (defined by Open Brewery DB) for a selected State by the user.

### User Stories

User Stories for Breweries API...

-	As a potential customer, I would like to see more detailed information about the Brewery I select, so I can make suggestions to my friends as to what Breweries are good. 

Acceptance Criteria: Add Google Maps to an address link, and do they serve food.  If so, provide a food menu.

-	As a frequent visitor of Breweries, I like to visit a different Brewery when I go out with my friends.  I would like to know what the ranking is for the Brewery within the State. The ranking information will entice me to visit the higher ranking Breweries more often.

Acceptance Criteria: Display the rankings of three sources within the State selected.

-	As a Brewery customer, I would like to see information regarding promotions and special events offered by the Brewery.  This information would be a good way to meet new people and try different types of beer.

Acceptance Criteria:  Obtain marketing information from the Breweries.
